# 📧 Email Verification Dashboard - Reoon API (Admin + User roles)

A standalone web dashboard (Node.js + Express + SQLite) that runs the same tools as the
Google Sheets automation, without Google Sheets:

| Tool | Google Sheet menu item | Dashboard |
|---|---|---|
| ⚡ Bulk Lead List Clean (7 accounts, daily credits only) | `🚀 Lead List Clean` | List page → **Lead List Clean** |
| ✉️ Verify Account Emails (per account, admin only) | `✉️ Verify Account Emails` | List page → **Verify with this account** (admins only) |
| 🔄 Check Pending Results / 🗑️ Clear Pending Tasks | same | Overview / List page |
| 🧹 Clean Decision Makers (keywords, seniority, industry, departments, country, optional 🤖 AI Prioritize via the same OpenAI key) | `🧹 Clean Decision Makers` | **Clean Decision Makers** page |
| 🤖 Company Names Cleaner (OpenAI GPT, batches of 100) | `🔄 Start Cleaning Company Names` | **Company Name Cleaner** page |
| 📊 info tab (activity log / misuse monitoring) | `info` sheet | **Activity Log** page |
| 🔃 Refresh & Show All Credits | same | **Credits** page + header pill |
| 📖 Guideline / Help | same | **Guideline / Help** page |

The sidebar is organised like the spreadsheet: **Sheets** (every uploaded CSV / XLSX is a sheet,
listed like tabs), then the **📧 Email Verifier menu exactly as in the Google Sheet** (same items,
order, labels, alerts and dialogs), then the read-only `info` activity log and the admin pages.
Every menu action lives in exactly one place and runs on the **selected sheet** (the one open on
screen), like `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet()`. Only one action can run at a time, so the same
job cannot be started twice by accident. The original `decision_maker.html` and
`GuidelineDialog.html` dialogs are reused (served from `public/dialogs/` with a tiny
`google.script.run` shim); the only addition is the **🤖 AI Prioritize** checkbox in `decision_maker.html`.

> The original Google Apps Script code is kept **unchanged** in `google-apps-script/`
> (that folder is in `.gitignore`, so it is never committed).

## Google Sheet import

Any "Add sheet" dialog (All sheets, Sheet Cleaner) has a **Google Sheet link** tab. Paste the link of a
Google Sheet that is shared as **Anyone with the link: Viewer**; the dashboard downloads the tab in
the link (or the first tab) through Google's public CSV export and stores it here as a sheet, so the
history stays in the dashboard. The Google Sheet itself is never modified. A sheet imported this way
shows its source link and an "Import again as a new sheet" button. No Google credentials are needed.

## 👥 Roles

## 🚀 Setup (5 minutes)

Requirements: **Node.js 22.13 or newer** (Node 24 recommended). No build tools / Visual Studio needed - the database uses Node's built-in SQLite.

```bash
# 1. install dependencies
npm install

# 2. create your config
cp .env.example .env
#    edit .env → set SESSION_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD,
#    and (optionally) API_KEY_<account> keys + CHATGPT_API_KEY

# 3. start
npm start
#    → http://localhost:3000
```

Log in with `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The first admin is created automatically on
first start (only when the database is empty). To create/promote an admin later:

```bash
npm run create-admin -- admin@example.com StrongPassword "Admin Name"
```

### API keys

* **Reoon accounts** - either put them in `.env` as `API_KEY_<name>=...` (same names as the
  sheet tabs: `emailastrallc`, `emranhossain`, `alimranshourov`, `aminsohel`, `amin`,
  `support`, `tool`) before the first start, **or** add/edit them any time in
  **Admin → API Keys & Settings**. Accounts can be enabled/disabled individually.
* **OpenAI** - `CHATGPT_API_KEY` in `.env` or **Admin → API Keys & Settings**. The model
  defaults to `gpt-4o-mini` (the sheet version used `gpt-3.5-turbo`; change it in Settings).

All data (users, keys, lists, activity) lives in `data/dashboard.sqlite`. Back up the
`data/` folder to keep everything.

## 🛠 How the sheet behaviours were mapped

* **Sheet tab → lead list (sheet).** Each uploaded file is a sheet; the `info` tab is the read-only Activity Log page. `Verification Status` and `Verification Date` columns are inserted
  right after `Email` when missing, exactly like the sheet code.
* **Time-based triggers → background intervals.** Lead List Clean polls Reoon every 10 s for up to
  100 s inside the request (the sheet's aggressive poll) and shows the same summary; pending tasks
  are then polled every `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 60 s) in the background. Company cleaning runs as a background job
  in batches of 100 rows and resumes automatically after a server restart.
* **PropertiesService / CacheService → SQLite tables** (`pending_tasks`, `credit_cache`,
  `settings`, `clean_jobs`).
* **`"Pending..."` rows** are still the marker used to write results back. Orphaned
  `Pending...` rows (no active task) can be cleared from the list page.
* **Info sheet → `activity` table** with the same 11 columns.
* **Admin lock** (`ezabulb@gmail.com` hard-coded in the sheet) → the `admin` role.

## 🔒 Security notes

* Passwords are bcrypt-hashed; sessions are signed, `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookies.
* Login is rate-limited (10 attempts / 15 min per IP + email).
* API keys are stored in the local SQLite database and only ever shown masked.
* Set `TRUST_PROXY=1` only when the app runs behind a reverse proxy or PaaS (Render, nginx), so client IPs are read from `X-Forwarded-For`.
* Sessions expire after 12 hours; changing a password logs out every other session of that user.
* CSV downloads neutralise formula-like cells (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`) so spreadsheets never execute them.
* Run behind HTTPS (e.g. nginx / Caddy reverse proxy) if exposed to the internet, and set a
  strong `SESSION_SECRET`.
